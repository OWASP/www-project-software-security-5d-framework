# The Survey

The SWSEC 5D survey is a tool designed to help organizations assess the maturity of their software security processes across the five dimensions of the SWSEC 5D framework. The survey consists of a series of questions that cover each of the five dimensions and is intended to be completed by individuals who are involved in the software development process, such as developers, security professionals, project managers, and executives.

The SWSEC 5D survey is a valuable tool for organizations that are looking to improve their software security posture. By completing the survey, organizations can gain a better understanding of their current level of maturity across the five dimensions of the SWSEC 5D framework. This information can then be used to identify areas where improvements can be made, and to develop a roadmap for improving the organization's software security processes.

The SWSEC 5D survey is typically administered by an independent third party, such as a consultant or a software security vendor. This helps to ensure that the results of the survey are objective and unbiased. The survey is usually administered online, and participants are typically given a set amount of time to complete the survey.

The SWSEC 5D survey consists of a series of questions that are designed to assess the maturity of the organization's software security processes across each of the five dimensions of the SWSEC 5D framework. For example, in the SwSec Processes dimension, questions may be asked about the organization's risk assessment process, its security requirements process, its threat modeling process, and its security design process.

In the SwSec Testing dimension, questions may be asked about the organization's adoption of security testing tools such as SAST, DAST, IAST, and RASP, as well as its use of external manual SCR and WAPT testing. In the SwSec Team dimension, questions may be asked about the roles and responsibilities of the organization's AppSec manager/CISO, security champions, AppSec specialists, satellite architects, satellite developers, and satellite auditors.

In the SwSec Awareness dimension, questions may be asked about the level of software security awareness among various roles within the organization, such as management, application owners, analysts, auditors, architects, developers, and engineers. Finally, in the SwSec Standards dimension, questions may be asked about the organization's adherence to software security standards such as the SW Security Roadmap (SAMM), risk analysis, threat modeling, secure architecture, secure coding, and software assurance.

Once the SWSEC 5D survey has been completed, the results are typically analyzed by the third-party consultant or vendor. The results are then presented to the organization in the form of a report, which typically includes a summary of the organization's current level of maturity across each of the five dimensions of the SWSEC 5D framework, as well as recommendations for improving the organization's software security processes.

Overall, the SWSEC 5D survey is a valuable tool for organizations that are looking to improve their software security posture. By assessing the organization's current level of maturity across each of the five dimensions of the SWSEC 5D framework, the survey can help organizations to identify areas where improvements can be made, and to develop a roadmap for improving their software security processes.
