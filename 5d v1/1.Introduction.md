# Introduction

In today's digital era, software security is a crucial aspect of any software development lifecycle (SDLC). In recent years, cyber attacks and data breaches have become increasingly common, and organizations have to be vigilant to secure their applications from such threats. To address this issue, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has come up with the Software Security 5 Dimension project, a comprehensive framework to evaluate the maturity of an organization's SDLC.

## Why another maturity model?

The need for software security frameworks like OWASP SwSec 5D arises from the increasing number of cyber threats that organizations face in today's digital landscape. While there are existing software development life cycle (SDLC) frameworks like the Waterfall model and Agile methodology, these traditional models lack a clear focus on security, which makes them inadequate for addressing security issues in software development. Therefore, OWASP SwSec 5D was developed to provide a more practical framework that focuses on evaluating the maturity of an organization's software development life cycle from a security perspective.

Comparing OWASP SwSec 5D to other software security frameworks, it is worth noting that it is closely related to OWASP SAMM and BSIMM. OWASP SAMM is a maturity model that focuses on software security practices in an organization. It provides a comprehensive guide for software security activities and helps organizations identify their strengths and weaknesses in software security practices. BSIMM, on the other hand, is a benchmarking model that focuses on the maturity of an organization's software security practices by comparing it to other organizations of similar size and industry.

Compared to OWASP SAMM and BSIMM, OWASP SwSec 5D has a more practical approach and focuses on evaluating the maturity of an organization's SDLC based on five dimensions. It addresses the need for a clear focus on security throughout the SDLC, provides a set of security standards, and includes security testing tools adopted by the organization. The five dimensions are SwSec Processes, SwSec Testing, SwSec Team, SwSec Awareness, and SwSec Standards.

Another key difference between OWASP SwSec 5D and other frameworks like SDLC, OWASP SAMM, and BSIMM is that it is derived from the experience of IMQ Minded Security performing software security assessments for many companies. Therefore, it is grounded in practical experience and addresses the specific challenges that organizations face in software development.

In conclusion, OWASP SwSec 5D provides a more practical approach to evaluating the maturity of an organization's software development life cycle from a security perspective. It addresses the need for a clear focus on security throughout the SDLC and provides a set of security standards and testing tools. Although there are other software security frameworks like SDLC, OWASP SAMM, and BSIMM, OWASP SwSec 5D stands out due to its practical approach and its focus on the specific challenges faced by organizations in software development.

## Project Description

The Software Security 5D framework was originally developed by IMQ Minded Security, a leading provider of software security services. The framework is based on years of experience performing software security assessments for various organizations, as well as input from the OWASP community and OWASP SAMM community.

In September 2018, IMQ Minded Security donated the framework to OWASP, making it a part of its comprehensive software security offerings. The framework aims to address the limitations of traditional secure SDLC frameworks, which often lack a level of awareness for all stakeholders involved in the process, a clear description of the application security roles involved, a set of security standards, and security testing tools adopted.

The Software Security 5D framework is a practical framework that focuses on five dimensions to evaluate the maturity of an organization's SDLC. These dimensions are:

### SwSec Processes

The SwSec Processes dimension focuses on the processes involved in software development, including requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and deployment. The framework evaluates whether the organization has a defined set of processes that address software security issues at every stage of the SDLC. It also assesses whether these processes are followed consistently across different teams and projects.

### SwSec Testing

The SwSec Testing dimension evaluates the testing procedures used by the organization to identify and mitigate software security risks. The framework assesses whether the organization has a defined set of testing procedures that address software security issues, including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and code review. It also evaluates the frequency and thoroughness of these tests and whether they are integrated into the SDLC.

### SwSec Team

The SwSec Team dimension evaluates the knowledge and skills of the team members involved in the SDLC. The framework assesses whether the organization has a defined set of roles and responsibilities related to software security, including a security champion, a security officer, and a security team. It also evaluates the training and education provided to team members to ensure they have the necessary knowledge and skills to address software security issues.

### SwSec Awareness

The SwSec Awareness dimension evaluates the level of awareness of software security issues among all stakeholders involved in the SDLC, including developers, testers, project managers, and business stakeholders. The framework assesses whether the organization has a defined set of awareness programs that address software security issues and whether they are regularly communicated to stakeholders.

### SwSec Standards

The SwSec Standards dimension evaluates the security standards and guidelines adopted by the organization to address software security issues. The framework assesses whether the organization has a defined set of security standards, including industry standards such as ISO 27001, NIST, and OWASP Top 10. It also evaluates whether the organization has defined guidelines for secure coding practices and secure architecture.

### Benefits of the Software Security 5D Framework

The Software Security 5D framework provides several benefits to organizations looking to improve the security of their software development process. These benefits include:

- A comprehensive framework: The framework covers all aspects of software security and provides a comprehensive approach to evaluate the maturity of an organization's SDLC.

- Practical approach: The framework takes a practical approach to evaluate the maturity of an organization's SDLC, focusing on five key dimensions.

- Alignment with industry standards: The framework aligns with industry standards such as ISO 27001, NIST, and OWASP SAMM, providing a recognized set of guidelines.
