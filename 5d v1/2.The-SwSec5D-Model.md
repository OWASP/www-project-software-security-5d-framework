# The model

The OWASP Software Security 5D framework is designed to help organizations focus on the key areas of software security that are important for managing software security risks throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). The framework consists of five dimensions, which are SwSec PROCESSES, SwSec TESTING, SwSec TEAM, SwSec AWARENESS, and SwSec STANDARDS.

Each dimension covers specific areas related to software security, such as risk assessment, security requirements, threat modeling, security testing, team roles, security training, and security standards. By focusing on these dimensions, organizations can ensure that software security risks are managed effectively and that software is developed and maintained with security in mind.

The ultimate goal of the framework is to help organizations improve their software security posture and reduce the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches. By adopting the OWASP Software Security 5D framework, organizations can ensure that they have a comprehensive and practical approach to managing software security risks throughout the software development life cycle.

## SwSec PROCESSES:
SwSec PROCESSES is one of the five dimensions of the OWASP Software Security 5D framework. It covers the processes that organizations use to manage software security risks throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). This includes various activities such as risk assessment, security requirements, threat modeling, security design, software acceptance, and security bug fixing. Risk assessment involves identifying potential security risks and determining their likelihood and impact. Security requirements define the security features and controls that should be implemented in the software. Threat modeling is a process of identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities and designing security controls to mitigate them. Security design involves implementing security controls and measures to protect the software. Software acceptance ensures that the software meets the security requirements and standards. Finally, security bug fixing involves identifying and fixing security bugs and vulnerabilities in the software.

![SwSec 5D Processes](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-software-security-5d-framework/blob/master/assets/images/SwSec5DProcess.png)\
 *Figure 2: SwSec 5D Processes*

The first dimension focuses on the following assets:
#### Risk Assessment 
Risk assessment involves identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing potential risks to the security of the software system. This can help organizations determine the appropriate security controls and measures to mitigate these risks.
 
#### Security Requirements 
Security requirements specify the security features, controls, and measures that must be incorporated into the software system to ensure its security.

#### Threat Modeling 
Threat modeling is the process of identifying potential threats to the software system and developing countermeasures to prevent or mitigate them.
 
#### Secure Design 
Secure design involves developing a secure architecture and design for the software system that incorporates security best practices and principles.

#### SCR, WAPT
SCR (Secure Code Review) and WAPT (Web Application Penetration Testing) are methods used to identify vulnerabilities in the software code and web applications, respectively.

#### Software Acceptance
Software acceptance involves testing and verifying that the software system meets the specified security requirements and that it is secure and reliable.

#### Security bug Fixing
Security bug fixing involves identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the software code and system to ensure its security and reliability.

## SwSec TESTING:
SwSec TESTING is another dimension of the OWASP Software Security 5D framework that focuses on testing and evaluating the security of software. This includes the adoption of tools such as static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application security testing (IAST), and runtime application self-protection (RASP). These tools can help organizations to identify security vulnerabilities in their software at different stages of the SDLC. External manual SCR (Security Code Review) and WAPT (Web Application Penetration Testing) are also included in SwSec TESTING to ensure that the software is thoroughly tested and evaluated for potential security risks.

![SwSec 5D Testing](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-software-security-5d-framework/blob/master/assets/images/SwSec5DTesting.png)\
 *Figure 3: SwSec 5D Testing*

Testing dimension investigates on the following practices:
#### Adoption of tool like: SAST, DAST, IAST, RASP
There are several types of software security testing, including static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application security testing (IAST), and runtime application self-protection (RASP). 

SAST is a type of software security testing that involves analyzing the source code of an application to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It is typically performed during the development phase and involves analyzing the code without executing it. 
SAST tools can identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, injection flaws, and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. SAST can help developers identify and fix vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing the cost and time required to fix them later.

DAST is a type of software security testing that involves testing the running application from the outside to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It is typically performed during the testing phase and involves sending requests to the application and analyzing the responses. DAST tools can identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and broken authentication and session management (BASM) vulnerabilities. DAST can help organizations identify vulnerabilities that may not be found during SAST testing.

IAST is a type of software security testing that combines elements of both SAST and DAST testing. It is performed during the testing phase and involves testing the running application while monitoring the application's behavior at the code level. IAST tools can identify vulnerabilities that may be missed by SAST or DAST testing, such as vulnerabilities related to business logic or custom code.

RASP is a type of software security testing that is performed during runtime. It involves monitoring the application's behavior during runtime to identify and mitigate attacks in real-time. RASP tools can detect and block attacks, such as injection attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, before they can cause damage to the application. RASP can help organizations identify and respond to attacks in real-time, reducing the risk of damage to the application and data.
Adopting a combination of these software security testing tools can help organizations identify and mitigate vulnerabilities and threats in their software systems throughout the software development life cycle. By incorporating these tools into their software development process, organizations can reduce the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches, improve the security and reliability of their software systems, and build trust with their customers and stakeholders.

#### External manual SCR, WAPT
External manual security code review (SCR) and web application penetration testing (WAPT) are two important types of security testing that can help organizations identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in their software systems. Unlike automated testing tools, which can identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, manual testing can identify vulnerabilities that are specific to an organization's software environment.

SCR involves a manual examination of the source code of an application by a security expert to identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses. The security expert examines the code to identify vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection flaws, and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. SCR can help organizations identify vulnerabilities that may not be detected by automated testing tools, as it involves a deeper understanding of the software system and its components.

WAPT is a manual testing technique that involves simulating attacks on a web application to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It is performed by security experts who attempt to penetrate the web application and access sensitive data or functionality. WAPT can identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and broken authentication and session management (BASM) vulnerabilities. WAPT can help organizations identify vulnerabilities that may not be detected by automated testing tools or manual SCR, as it involves an active attempt to penetrate the web application.

Both manual SCR and WAPT testing require specialized expertise and can be time-consuming and costly. However, they can provide a high level of assurance that the software system is secure and resilient to cyber attacks. Organizations can benefit from manual testing by identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses that may not be detected by automated testing tools, reducing the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks, and building trust with their customers and stakeholders.

External manual security code review and web application penetration testing should be considered as an important part of a comprehensive software security testing program. By incorporating these manual testing techniques into their software development process, organizations can identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in their software systems and take proactive steps to mitigate these risks.

## SwSec TEAM:
