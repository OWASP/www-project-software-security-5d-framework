# The model

The OWASP Software Security 5D framework is designed to help organizations focus on the key areas of software security that are important for managing software security risks throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). The framework consists of five dimensions, which are SwSec PROCESSES, SwSec TESTING, SwSec TEAM, SwSec AWARENESS, and SwSec STANDARDS.

Each dimension covers specific areas related to software security, such as risk assessment, security requirements, threat modeling, security testing, team roles, security training, and security standards. By focusing on these dimensions, organizations can ensure that software security risks are managed effectively and that software is developed and maintained with security in mind.

The ultimate goal of the framework is to help organizations improve their software security posture and reduce the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches. By adopting the OWASP Software Security 5D framework, organizations can ensure that they have a comprehensive and practical approach to managing software security risks throughout the software development life cycle.

## SwSec PROCESSES:
SwSec PROCESSES is one of the five dimensions of the OWASP Software Security 5D framework. It covers the processes that organizations use to manage software security risks throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). This includes various activities such as risk assessment, security requirements, threat modeling, security design, software acceptance, and security bug fixing. Risk assessment involves identifying potential security risks and determining their likelihood and impact. Security requirements define the security features and controls that should be implemented in the software. Threat modeling is a process of identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities and designing security controls to mitigate them. Security design involves implementing security controls and measures to protect the software. Software acceptance ensures that the software meets the security requirements and standards. Finally, security bug fixing involves identifying and fixing security bugs and vulnerabilities in the software.

The first dimension focus on the folling assets:
- Risk Assessment: Risk assessment involves identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing potential risks to the security of the software system. This can help organizations determine the appropriate security controls and measures to mitigate these risks.
 
- Security Requirements: Security requirements specify the security features, controls, and measures that must be incorporated into the software system to ensure its security.

- Threat Modeling: Threat modeling is the process of identifying potential threats to the software system and developing countermeasures to prevent or mitigate them.
 
- Security Design: Security design involves developing a secure architecture and design for the software system that incorporates security best practices and principles.

- SCR, WAPT: SCR (Securt Code Review) and WAPT (Web Application Penetration Testing) are methods used to identify vulnerabilities in the software code and web applications, respectively.

- Software Acceptance: Software acceptance involves testing and verifying that the software system meets the specified security requirements and that it is secure and reliable.

- Security bug Fixing: Security bug fixing involves identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the software code and system to ensure its security and reliability.

## SwSec TESTING:
SwSec TESTING is another dimension of the OWASP Software Security 5D framework that focuses on testing and evaluating the security of software. This includes the adoption of tools such as static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application security testing (IAST), and runtime application self-protection (RASP). These tools can help organizations to identify security vulnerabilities in their software at different stages of the SDLC. External manual SCR (Security Code Review) and WAPT (Web Application Penetration Testing) are also included in SwSec TESTING to ensure that the software is thoroughly tested and evaluated for potential security risks.

Testing dimension investigates on the following practices:
- Adoption of tool like: SAST, DAST, IAST, RASP
- External manual SCR, WAPT

## SwSec TEAM:
SwSec TEAM dimension focuses on the team members involved in software security. This includes AppSec managers or Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), security champions, AppSec specialists, satellite architects, satellite developers, and satellite auditors. The AppSec manager or CISO is responsible for overseeing the software security program and ensuring that it is integrated into the organization's overall security strategy. Security champions are team members who promote and advocate for software security within their teams. AppSec specialists are security professionals with specialized knowledge and skills in software security. Satellite architects, developers, and auditors are team members who work on specific projects or applications and are responsible for ensuring that the software is designed, developed, and tested with security in mind.

This dimension looks at the following roles:
- AppSec manager/CISO
- Sec Champions
- AppSec Specialists
- Satellite Architects
- Satellite Developers
- Satellite Auditors

## SwSec AWARENESS:
SwSec AWARENESS dimension focuses on the awareness and training of team members involved in the software development life cycle. This includes management, application owners, analysts, auditors, architects, developers, and engineers. Organizations can provide security training to team members to improve their understanding of software security risks and how to identify and mitigate them. By raising awareness about software security, organizations can promote a culture of security and ensure that team members understand the importance of software security throughout the SDLC.

- Management
- Application Owners
- Analysts
- Auditors 
- Architects
- Developers
- Engineers 

## SwSec STANDARDS:
SwSec STANDARDS dimension focuses on the standards and guidelines that organizations use to manage software security risks. This includes the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM), risk analysis, threat modeling, secure architecture, secure coding, and software assurance. The OWASP SAMM provides a framework for organizations to measure and improve their software security maturity. Risk analysis and threat modeling are used to identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities in the software. Secure architecture and secure coding guidelines provide best practices for designing and developing software with security in mind. Software assurance includes various activities such as testing, auditing, and code reviews to ensure that the software meets the security requirements and standards. By following these standards and guidelines, organizations can improve their software security posture and reduce the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches.

The fifth dimension analises if the following standards are in place:
- Sw Security Roadmap (SAMM) 
- Risk analysis 
- Threat Modeling 
- Secure Architecture 
- Secure Coding 
- Software Assurance
