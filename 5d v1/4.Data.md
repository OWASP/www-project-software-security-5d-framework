# The Data

The self-assessment in the OWASP SwSec 5D project provides a way for companies to evaluate their software security practices and identify areas for improvement. Once the assessment is completed, the results can be used to generate a report that highlights the company's level of maturity in each of the five dimensions.

The report can provide valuable insights into the company's software security practices and identify areas where improvements can be made. For example, if the company scores low in the SwSec TESTING dimension, it may be an indication that they need to adopt more testing tools like SAST, DAST, IAST, or RASP, or perform more external manual SCR and WAPT testing. Alternatively, if the company scores low in the SwSec TEAM dimension, it may indicate that they need to establish more roles like AppSec manager/CISO, Sec Champions, AppSec Specialists, or Satellite Architects.

The report can also provide a comparison of the company's maturity level with other organizations that have completed the self-assessment. This can provide a benchmark for the company to compare its maturity level against industry standards and best practices. Additionally, the report can be used to communicate the current state of the company's software security practices to stakeholders, including management, customers, and partners.

In summary, the self-assessment in the OWASP SwSec 5D project provides a valuable tool for companies to evaluate their software security practices and identify areas for improvement. The results of the assessment can be used to generate a report that provides insights into the company's software security practices and can be used to compare against industry standards and best practices. The report can also be used to communicate the current state of the company's software security practices to stakeholders.

The following is an example of results:

The SwSec 5D Framework provides a comprehensive view of the company's software security practices, and the scorecard helps the company to identify the areas where it needs to improve. This way, the company can prioritize its efforts and resources to improve its software security practices in a structured and efficient way.

The SwSec 5D Framework provides a practical and comprehensive approach to evaluate the maturity of a company's software security practices. The scorecard enables the company to identify the areas where it needs to improve, and prioritize its efforts and resources to improve its software security practices. By implementing the recommendations provided by the SwSec 5D Framework, the company can enhance its software security practices, reduce the risk of security breaches, and increase the trust of its customers and stakeholders.

The following scorecard enlights what the assessed company is implementing today and what is missing. You can identify immediately the level of maturity for each dimension. Only 1 level has reached the right maturity. The Framework tells you that you MUST grow in all 5 dimensions in order to be mature.

During our study, we conducted 17 assessments, analyzing 12 financial institutions and 5 independent software vendors. Our research aimed to provide insight into the current state of software security in the financial sector, highlighting areas for improvement and potential best practices. Through a rigorous evaluation of each organization's software security processes, testing, team, awareness, and standards, we were able to draw meaningful conclusions about the state of software security across the industry.
