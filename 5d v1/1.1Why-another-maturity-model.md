## Why another maturity model?

The need for software security frameworks like OWASP SwSec 5D arises from the increasing number of cyber threats that organizations face in today's digital landscape. While there are existing software development life cycle (SDLC) frameworks like the Waterfall model and Agile methodology, these traditional models lack a clear focus on security, which makes them inadequate for addressing security issues in software development. Therefore, OWASP SwSec 5D was developed to provide a more practical framework that focuses on evaluating the maturity of an organization's software development life cycle from a security perspective.

Comparing OWASP SwSec 5D to other software security frameworks, it is worth noting that it is closely related to OWASP SAMM and BSIMM. OWASP SAMM is a maturity model that focuses on software security practices in an organization. It provides a comprehensive guide for software security activities and helps organizations identify their strengths and weaknesses in software security practices. BSIMM, on the other hand, is a benchmarking model that focuses on the maturity of an organization's software security practices by comparing it to other organizations of similar size and industry.

Compared to OWASP SAMM and BSIMM, OWASP SwSec 5D has a more practical approach and focuses on evaluating the maturity of an organization's SDLC based on five dimensions. It addresses the need for a clear focus on security throughout the SDLC, provides a set of security standards, and includes security testing tools adopted by the organization. The five dimensions are SwSec Processes, SwSec Testing, SwSec Team, SwSec Awareness, and SwSec Standards.

In conclusion, OWASP SwSec 5D provides a more practical approach to evaluating the maturity of an organization's software development life cycle from a security perspective. It addresses the need for a clear focus on security throughout the SDLC and provides a set of security standards and testing tools. Although there are other software security frameworks like SDLC, OWASP SAMM, and BSIMM, OWASP SwSec 5D stands out due to its practical approach and its focus on the specific challenges faced by organizations in software development.

The OWASP 5D framework was designed to help companies understand the need to grow in all five dimensions simultaneously, rather than focusing on just one or two. In order to be considered mature, a company must be mature in all five dimensions.

### Benefits of the Software Security 5D Framework

The Software Security 5D framework provides several benefits to organizations looking to improve the security of their software development process. These benefits include:

- A comprehensive framework: The framework covers all aspects of software security and provides a comprehensive approach to evaluate the maturity of an organization's SDLC.

- Practical approach: The framework takes a practical approach to evaluate the maturity of an organization's SDLC, focusing on five key dimensions.

- Alignment with industry standards: The framework aligns with industry standards such as ISO 27001, NIST, and OWASP SAMM, providing a recognized set of guidelines.
