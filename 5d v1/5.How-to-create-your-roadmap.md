# Roadmap and activites to implement

At the end of the assessment we can collect the results and given the set of activities to implement if the results are less then value 3.

### SWSEC PROCESSES

PR1 Implement a Risk Assessment process in order to categorize by risk your applications

PR2 Security Requirements (standard use cases, new vulns)

PR3 Implement a Security Architecture Process in order to have a Company standard of reviewed architectures

PR4 Realizing the threat modeling methodology to be applied to projects valued at medium to high risk in the definition phase of the project;

PR5 Secure Design

PR6 SCR and WAPT standard are necessary to perform the security analysis following your internal standards

PR7 Create a Software Assurance process to be sure that the development phase is following all your security requirements

PR 8 implement a Security bug fixing process lead by satellite developers

PR 9 Secure Monitoring using WAF or RASP technologies

### SWSEC TESTING

TS1 Utilize automated security testing tools for all the applications (DAST and IAST tools are preferred);

TS2 Utilize automated secure code analysis tools for all the software (SAST and IAST tool are preferred).

TS3 Utilize manual testing for high risk applications;

TS4  Utilize manual secure code review during the development for high risk projects.

### SWSEC TEAM

TE1 Formalize the Security Manager role in order to strengthen the real role in the company. He must become the guarantor of the dissemination of culture on software security, and the focal point in your company for the adoption of standards and security processes in software development.

TE2 Identify Security Champions or externalize this function

### SWSEC AWARENESS

AW1 Conduct security awareness training for all people involved in SDLC: half a day for managers, architects, developers, marketing 

AW2 Plan trainings for analysts: “Threat Modeling” (2 days);

AW3 Trainings for developers: 'Building Secure Software for specific platforms' (2-5 days).

### SWSEC STANDARDS

SS1 Maintain a Software Security Roadmap using the OWASP SAMM model.

SS2 Build and maintain secure coding guidelines for your developing environments; share the guidelines with development teams with training courses with final exam.

SS3 Review security requirements into supplier agreements for the Governance of the Software Security with the outsourcers

SS4 Classify data and applications based on business risk.

SS5 Maintain a list of recommended software frameworks to use in your projects.

SS6 Explicitly apply security principles to design using a Threat Modeling standard.

SS7 Establish formal Secure architectures and platforms standards.

# Results

The self-assessment in the OWASP SwSec 5D project provides a way for companies to evaluate their software security practices and identify areas for improvement. Once the assessment is completed, the results can be used to generate a report that highlights the company's level of maturity in each of the five dimensions.

The report can provide valuable insights into the company's software security practices and identify areas where improvements can be made. For example, if the company scores low in the SwSec TESTING dimension, it may be an indication that they need to adopt more testing tools like SAST, DAST, IAST, or RASP, or perform more external manual SCR and WAPT testing. Alternatively, if the company scores low in the SwSec TEAM dimension, it may indicate that they need to establish more roles like AppSec manager/CISO, Sec Champions, AppSec Specialists, or Satellite Architects.

The report can also provide a comparison of the company's maturity level with other organizations that have completed the self-assessment. This can provide a benchmark for the company to compare its maturity level against industry standards and best practices. Additionally, the report can be used to communicate the current state of the company's software security practices to stakeholders, including management, customers, and partners.

In summary, the self-assessment in the OWASP SwSec 5D project provides a valuable tool for companies to evaluate their software security practices and identify areas for improvement. The results of the assessment can be used to generate a report that provides insights into the company's software security practices and can be used to compare against industry standards and best practices. The report can also be used to communicate the current state of the company's software security practices to stakeholders.

OWASP SAMM Assessment and 5D Framework are two important standards that help companies to develop their software security strategies. In this essay, we will explore both frameworks in detail and highlight their benefits and limitations.

One of the key benefits of the OWASP SAMM Assessment is that it provides a comprehensive view of software security. The framework covers all aspects of software security, from governance to deployment. This ensures that organizations have a complete understanding of their software security posture and can identify areas for improvement.

Another benefit of the OWASP SAMM Assessment is that it is adaptable to different types of organizations and software development lifecycles. The framework is designed to be flexible and can be customized to meet the unique needs of each organization. This allows organizations to develop a software security strategy that is tailored to their specific needs.

However, the OWASP SAMM Assessment also has some limitations. One limitation is that it can be time-consuming and resource-intensive to complete. The framework requires organizations to conduct a detailed analysis of their software security practices, which can be a significant undertaking. Additionally, the framework does not provide guidance on how to implement the recommended activities, which can be challenging for organizations that are new to software security.

The OWASP 5D Framework is a comprehensive framework that focuses on five dimensions of software security: Processes, Testing, Team, Awareness, and Standards. The framework is designed to provide a practical approach to software security that is easy to implement and understand. The 5D Framework is based on the principle that software security is not just the responsibility of the security team but of everyone involved in the software development process.

The 5D Framework includes a detailed checklist of activities for each dimension of software security. The checklist includes both qualitative and quantitative measures, which allows organizations to measure their progress over time. The framework is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of organizations and software development lifecycles.

However, the 5D Framework also has some limitations. One limitation is that it may not be as comprehensive as other frameworks, such as the OWASP SAMM Assessment. The framework focuses on five dimensions of software security, while other frameworks may cover a broader range of topics. Additionally, the framework may not be suitable for organizations with more complex software development lifecycles or security requirements.

### The OWASP 5D framework was designed to help companies understand the need to grow in all five dimensions simultaneously, rather than focusing on just one or two. In order to be considered mature, a company must be mature in all five dimensions.
