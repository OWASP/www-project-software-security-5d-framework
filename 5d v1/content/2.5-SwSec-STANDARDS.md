## SwSec STANDARDS:
SwSec STANDARDS dimension focuses on the standards and guidelines that organizations use to manage software security risks. This includes the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM), risk analysis, threat modeling, secure architecture, secure coding, and software assurance. The OWASP SAMM provides a framework for organizations to measure and improve their software security maturity. Risk analysis and threat modeling are used to identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities in the software. Secure architecture and secure coding guidelines provide best practices for designing and developing software with security in mind. Software assurance includes various activities such as testing, auditing, and code reviews to ensure that the software meets the security requirements and standards. By following these standards and guidelines, organizations can improve their software security posture and reduce the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches.

The fifth dimension of the OWASP Software Security 5D Framework focuses on the implementation of standards related to software security. In order to effectively manage software security, companies need to have a solid understanding of the threats they face and the best practices to mitigate those threats. This dimension looks at the standards and practices that are in place to address software security concerns. Here are the standards that are analyzed as part of this dimension:

#### Sw Security Roadmap (SAMM)
The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is a framework for building and improving software security programs. SAMM provides a set of guidelines and best practices that organizations can use to assess and improve their software security posture. The framework is divided into three areas: governance, construction, and verification. SAMM can be used as a roadmap for organizations to build and maintain secure software.

#### Risk analysis
Risk analysis is an important part of software security. It involves identifying and evaluating potential risks to the software and its data. A risk analysis should be performed for each project to identify and prioritize potential security risks. This analysis should consider the impact of the risk, the likelihood of the risk occurring, and the cost to mitigate the risk. The results of the risk analysis should be used to guide the implementation of security controls and to prioritize testing efforts.

#### Threat Modeling
Threat modeling is the process of identifying and prioritizing potential threats to a software system. The goal of threat modeling is to identify vulnerabilities in the software and to prioritize them based on their potential impact on the system. Threat modeling can be done at different stages of the software development lifecycle and should be performed whenever there are changes to the system or its environment.

#### Secure Architecture
Secure architecture is the design of software systems that are secure by design. Secure architecture should consider security at all levels of the system, including the network, application, and data layers. Secure architecture should also consider the potential threats to the system and should include appropriate security controls to mitigate those threats.

#### Secure Coding
Secure coding is the practice of writing code that is free from security vulnerabilities. Secure coding practices include following secure coding standards, using secure coding techniques, and testing code for security vulnerabilities. Secure coding should be integrated into the software development process to ensure that all code is secure by design.

#### Software Assurance
Software assurance is the process of ensuring that software is reliable, maintainable, and secure. Software assurance includes testing software for security vulnerabilities, patching software when vulnerabilities are discovered, and monitoring software for potential security issues. Software assurance should be part of the software development lifecycle and should be integrated into the software development process.

Overall, the fifth dimension of the OWASP Software Security 5D Framework provides a comprehensive view of the standards and practices that should be in place to ensure software security. By adopting these standards, organizations can build and maintain secure software that is resistant to potential threats and vulnerabilities. It is important for organizations to have a solid understanding of these standards and to integrate them into their software development process to ensure the security of their software systems.

In the next chaper we will focus on the survey.
