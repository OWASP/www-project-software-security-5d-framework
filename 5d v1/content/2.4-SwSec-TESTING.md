## SwSec TESTING
SwSec TESTING is another dimension of the OWASP Software Security 5D framework that focuses on testing and evaluating the security of software. This includes the adoption of tools such as static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application security testing (IAST), and runtime application self-protection (RASP). These tools can help organizations to identify security vulnerabilities in their software at different stages of the SDLC. External manual SCR (Security Code Review) and WAPT (Web Application Penetration Testing) are also included in SwSec TESTING to ensure that the software is thoroughly tested and evaluated for potential security risks.

Testing dimension investigates on the following practices:
#### Adoption of tool like: SAST, DAST, IAST, RASP
There are several types of software security testing, including static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application security testing (IAST), and runtime application self-protection (RASP). 

SAST is a type of software security testing that involves analyzing the source code of an application to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It is typically performed during the development phase and involves analyzing the code without executing it. 
SAST tools can identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, injection flaws, and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. SAST can help developers identify and fix vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing the cost and time required to fix them later.

DAST is a type of software security testing that involves testing the running application from the outside to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It is typically performed during the testing phase and involves sending requests to the application and analyzing the responses. DAST tools can identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and broken authentication and session management (BASM) vulnerabilities. DAST can help organizations identify vulnerabilities that may not be found during SAST testing.

IAST is a type of software security testing that combines elements of both SAST and DAST testing. It is performed during the testing phase and involves testing the running application while monitoring the application's behavior at the code level. IAST tools can identify vulnerabilities that may be missed by SAST or DAST testing, such as vulnerabilities related to business logic or custom code.

RASP is a type of software security testing that is performed during runtime. It involves monitoring the application's behavior during runtime to identify and mitigate attacks in real-time. RASP tools can detect and block attacks, such as injection attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, before they can cause damage to the application. RASP can help organizations identify and respond to attacks in real-time, reducing the risk of damage to the application and data.
Adopting a combination of these software security testing tools can help organizations identify and mitigate vulnerabilities and threats in their software systems throughout the software development life cycle. By incorporating these tools into their software development process, organizations can reduce the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches, improve the security and reliability of their software systems, and build trust with their customers and stakeholders.

#### External manual SCR, WAPT
External manual security code review (SCR) and web application penetration testing (WAPT) are two important types of security testing that can help organizations identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in their software systems. Unlike automated testing tools, which can identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, manual testing can identify vulnerabilities that are specific to an organization's software environment.

SCR involves a manual examination of the source code of an application by a security expert to identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses. The security expert examines the code to identify vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection flaws, and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. SCR can help organizations identify vulnerabilities that may not be detected by automated testing tools, as it involves a deeper understanding of the software system and its components.

WAPT is a manual testing technique that involves simulating attacks on a web application to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It is performed by security experts who attempt to penetrate the web application and access sensitive data or functionality. WAPT can identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and broken authentication and session management (BASM) vulnerabilities. WAPT can help organizations identify vulnerabilities that may not be detected by automated testing tools or manual SCR, as it involves an active attempt to penetrate the web application.

Both manual SCR and WAPT testing require specialized expertise and can be time-consuming and costly. However, they can provide a high level of assurance that the software system is secure and resilient to cyber attacks. Organizations can benefit from manual testing by identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses that may not be detected by automated testing tools, reducing the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks, and building trust with their customers and stakeholders.

External manual security code review and web application penetration testing should be considered as an important part of a comprehensive software security testing program. By incorporating these manual testing techniques into their software development process, organizations can identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in their software systems and take proactive steps to mitigate these risks.
