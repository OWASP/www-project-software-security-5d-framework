# 2. The SwSec 5D model

The OWASP Software Security 5D framework is designed to help organizations focus on the key areas of software security that are important for managing software security risks throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). The framework consists of five dimensions, which are SwSec PROCESSES, SwSec TESTING, SwSec TEAM, SwSec AWARENESS, and SwSec STANDARDS.

Each dimension covers specific areas related to software security, such as risk assessment, security requirements, threat modeling, security testing, team roles, security training, and security standards. By focusing on these dimensions, organizations can ensure that software security risks are managed effectively and that software is developed and maintained with security in mind.

The ultimate goal of the framework is to help organizations improve their software security posture and reduce the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches. By adopting the OWASP Software Security 5D framework, organizations can ensure that they have a comprehensive and practical approach to managing software security risks throughout the software development life cycle.

Let's have a look the details of the 5 Dimensions:
