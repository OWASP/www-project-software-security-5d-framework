# 4. The Data

The SwSec 5D Framework provides a comprehensive view of the company's software security practices, and the scorecard helps the company to identify the areas where it needs to improve. This way, the company can prioritize its efforts and resources to improve its software security practices in a structured and efficient way.

The SwSec 5D Framework provides a practical and comprehensive approach to evaluate the maturity of a company's software security practices. The scorecard enables the company to identify the areas where it needs to improve, and prioritize its efforts and resources to improve its software security practices. By implementing the recommendations provided by the SwSec 5D Framework, the company can enhance its software security practices, reduce the risk of security breaches, and increase the trust of its customers and stakeholders.

The following scorecard enlights what the assessed company is implementing today and what is missing. You can identify immediately the level of maturity for each dimension. Only 1 level has reached the right maturity. The Framework tells you that you MUST grow in all 5 dimensions in order to be mature.

During our study, we conducted 17 assessments, analyzing 12 financial institutions and 5 independent software vendors. Our research aimed to provide insight into the current state of software security in the financial sector, highlighting areas for improvement and potential best practices. Through a rigorous evaluation of each organization's software security processes, testing, team, awareness, and standards, we were able to draw meaningful conclusions about the state of software security across the industry.
