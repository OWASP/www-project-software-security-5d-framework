## SDLC and SwSec 5D Framework

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a methodology used in software engineering to manage the development of software projects. It is a structured approach that divides the software development process into different phases. The SDLC has undergone several transformations over the years, adapting to new technologies and development methodologies.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software development teams to design, develop, test and deploy high-quality software. The phases of a typical SDLC include:

### 1. Define: 
This is the initial phase where the project scope and requirements are identified, and a project plan is created. The feasibility study is also carried out to determine whether the project is technically and financially feasible.

### 2. Design: 
In this phase, the actual software is designed. This includes designing the software architecture, creating detailed design documents, and creating test plans.

### 3. Developing:
This is the phase where the actual coding takes place. The software is built, and the development team writes code based on the design documents created in the previous phase.

### 4. Deployment: 
After the software is tested and approved, it is deployed to production environments.

### 5. Maintenance: 
In this phase, the software is maintained and updated. Bug fixes, updates, and improvements are made to the software over time.

Each of these phases has a specific set of tasks and goals, and they are carried out sequentially, with each phase building on the previous one. Properly following a SDLC helps to ensure that software is built on time, on budget, and with a high level of quality.

The OWASP 5D framework is a methodology that can be used in conjunction with any SDLC methodology. It provides a structured approach to software security and addresses the need for security to be integrated into the software development process. The OWASP 5D framework focuses on five dimensions of software security, namely SwSec Processes, SwSec Testing, SwSec Team, SwSec Awareness, and SwSec Standards.

The following table describe the relationship between SDLC phases and all the 5 dimensions of the framework we are describing:

Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) is a methodology used by organizations to integrate security into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process. This approach ensures that security is considered at every stage of the software development process and not just as an afterthought.

The concept of Secure SDLC emerged in response to the growing number of security breaches resulting from vulnerabilities in software. It became clear that traditional SDLC processes did not sufficiently consider security, and as such, a new approach was needed. The goal of Secure SDLC is to identify, prevent, and remove security vulnerabilities early in the software development process, reducing the cost and impact of security incidents.

The implementation of Secure SDLC can vary depending on the organization, but generally, it involves the integration of security activities throughout the SDLC stages. The stages usually include planning, requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The Secure SDLC approach typically involves the use of security requirements, threat modeling, secure coding practices, security testing, and security reviews.

OWASP 5D Framework can be integrated into the Secure SDLC approach to ensure that software security is considered in every dimension of the SDLC. The 5D Framework emphasizes the importance of growing in all 5 dimensions simultaneously and avoiding focusing on only one or two areas. The 5 dimensions include SwSec Processes, SwSec Testing, SwSec Team, SwSec Awareness, and SwSec Standards.

In the next chapter we will describe the details of the framework.
