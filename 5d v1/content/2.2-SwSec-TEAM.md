## SwSec TEAM:
SwSec TEAM dimension focuses on the team members involved in software security. This includes AppSec managers or Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), security champions, AppSec specialists, satellite architects, satellite developers, and satellite auditors. The AppSec manager or CISO is responsible for overseeing the software security program and ensuring that it is integrated into the organization's overall security strategy. Security champions are team members who promote and advocate for software security within their teams. AppSec specialists are security professionals with specialized knowledge and skills in software security. Satellite architects, developers, and auditors are team members who work on specific projects or applications and are responsible for ensuring that the software is designed, developed, and tested with security in mind.

The third dimension of the OWASP Software Security 5D framework focuses on the roles and responsibilities of individuals within an organization responsible for software security. The following roles are essential to building and maintaining a robust software security program:

#### AppSec manager/CISO
The Application Security (AppSec) Manager or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for overseeing the software security program within an organization. They develop policies, procedures, and guidelines for secure software development, identify and mitigate security risks, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

#### Security Champions
Security champions are individuals within the development or engineering team who are passionate about software security. They act as a bridge between the AppSec team and the development team, advocating for secure coding practices and helping to raise awareness of security issues.

#### AppSec Specialists
Application security specialists are experts in software security who work closely with the development team to identify and mitigate security risks throughout the software development lifecycle. They provide guidance and support for secure coding practices, perform security assessments, and develop and implement security controls.

#### Satellite Architects:
Satellite architects are responsible for designing and implementing secure architectures for satellite systems or components. They work closely with the AppSec team and the development team to ensure that the satellite system or component is designed and implemented with security in mind.

#### Satellite Developers 
Satellite developers are responsible for developing and testing software for satellite systems or components. They work closely with the AppSec team and the satellite architects to ensure that the software is developed with security in mind.

#### Satellite Auditors
Satellite auditors are responsible for auditing the satellite system or component to ensure that it meets security requirements and standards. They work closely with the AppSec team and the development team to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses and develop and implement security controls.

These roles are essential to building and maintaining a strong software security program. Each role plays a critical part in ensuring that the software development process is secure and that software systems are designed, developed, and tested with security in mind. By having dedicated individuals in these roles, organizations can mitigate security risks and ensure that their software systems are secure and resilient to cyber attacks.
