## SwSec PROCESSES:
SwSec PROCESSES is one of the five dimensions of the OWASP Software Security 5D framework. It covers the processes that organizations use to manage software security risks throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). This includes various activities such as risk assessment, security requirements, threat modeling, security design, software acceptance, and security bug fixing. Risk assessment involves identifying potential security risks and determining their likelihood and impact. Security requirements define the security features and controls that should be implemented in the software. Threat modeling is a process of identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities and designing security controls to mitigate them. Security design involves implementing security controls and measures to protect the software. Software acceptance ensures that the software meets the security requirements and standards. Finally, security bug fixing involves identifying and fixing security bugs and vulnerabilities in the software.

The first dimension focuses on the following assets:
#### Risk Assessment 
Risk assessment involves identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing potential risks to the security of the software system. This can help organizations determine the appropriate security controls and measures to mitigate these risks.
 
#### Security Requirements 
Security requirements specify the security features, controls, and measures that must be incorporated into the software system to ensure its security.

#### Threat Modeling 
Threat modeling is the process of identifying potential threats to the software system and developing countermeasures to prevent or mitigate them.
 
#### Secure Design 
Secure design involves developing a secure architecture and design for the software system that incorporates security best practices and principles.

#### SCR, WAPT
SCR (Secure Code Review) and WAPT (Web Application Penetration Testing) are methods used to identify vulnerabilities in the software code and web applications, respectively.

#### Software Acceptance
Software acceptance involves testing and verifying that the software system meets the specified security requirements and that it is secure and reliable.

#### Security bug Fixing
Security bug fixing involves identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the software code and system to ensure its security and reliability.
